#       main.py: main script
#       Version 2.0.0, Domenico Lanza
#.................................................
#   I will re-write in python the program "Plasprobes" written by  Benoit Bottin, March 1999, VKI Ar. Dpt.(v1.1)
#   The previous code used the libray PEGASE 4.5, but unfortunately I did not manage to find it anywhere, so I will use the library
#   MUTATION++, which follows the same purpose.
#   Starting date: 01/28/2024
#   In this version, I will not strictly follow the original code, but I will try to make it more readable and easy to upgrade
